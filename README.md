# Logistic Regression - Multiclass Classification (Iris Dataset)

This project demonstrates **Logistic Regression** applied to **Multiclass Classification** using the well-known **Iris dataset**. It classifies flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their petal and sepal features.

## 📌 Key Features

- Used **Scikit-learn's LogisticRegression** for training
- Followed a **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** classification approach
- Implemented **train-test split** for model evaluation
- Evaluated performance using **accuracy score** and **confusion matrix**
- Visualized dataset and predictions using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Logistic Regression for Multiclass Classification
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Data Visualization

## 📂 Files

- `Logistic_Regression(Multiclass_Classification).ipynb`: Main notebook with full code and explanation

## 📊 Output Sample

- Accuracy Score: *e.g., 0.97*(OVR)
- Accuracy Score: *e.g., 1.0*(Multinomial)
